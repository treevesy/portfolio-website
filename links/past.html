			<h3>Computing HSC</h3>
			<p>In HSC I studied Software Design and Devlopment(SDD) and got a final mark of 94 and and exam mark of 95.</p>

			<p>I started getting into programming around the time I started my course of SDD in 2006. We started off learning Visual Basic and learnt the basics of creating windows forms and the code that went behind the functions on the form.</p>

			<h3>Programming</h3>
			<p>I learnt Javascript in the first year of SDD using an online site, CodeAcademy. After the first year of SDD I started to learn Python, HTML and CSS and started to develop my skills in these programming languages.</p>
			<p>Javascript taught me some fundamentals such as variables, control structures, loops, and abit of functions.</p>

			<p>It wasn't until I started learning Python on a groklearning.com that I started to really understand the fundamentals of coding. Learning Python reinforced my skills and taught me classes and Object-Oriented Programming and developed my skills with functions.</p>
			<h3>Javascript - Sun and stars</h3>
			<p>After learning Javascript on CodeAcademy I created a model of the solarsystem using the knowledge I had learnt. It involved creating a canvas and using HTML and CSS to display the canvas and drawing circles to orbit each other.</p>

			<h3>Python - Pong</h3>
			<p>After becoming fluent in Python I started creating some Python programs. One of the challenges I tried to do was recreating the classic Atari game Pong. I was successful at remaking pong and made it a first to 7 game.</p>

			<h3>Electronics</h3>
			<p>Recently I had been starting to learn abit electronics and started building circuits. I have a main interest in electronics and hope to be able to integrate my programming knowledge with electronic systems. Recently I bought 4 raspberry pi's to start learning how to use programming in circuits.</p>

			<h3>University</h3>
			<p>Now at UTS i'm learning Java and Bash. The fundamentals I learnt back in SDD definitely helped me to excel now in learning these two languages. Learning Javascript and Python really helped me wrap my head around certain concepts and tuaght me that alot of languages can do the same functions but have different syntax.</p>
